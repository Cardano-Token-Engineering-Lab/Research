CTEL Research and Documentation

This repo will serve as the Cardano Token Engineering Lab's principle data and documentation resource hub for research.  As projects and mechanisms are being worked, all official documentation and resources from the projects' teams will be stored here.

The kickoff of the CTEL project and as a part of the Project Catalyst Fund 11 Proposal is to do research and deep dive into three protocols in the Cardano Ecosystem to determine the efficacy of their token mechanisms and to provide qualitative and quantative review and feedback on the project. 

## Deep Dive Projects:
- [Liqwid Finance v](./Liqwid%20v2/) - A lending and borrowing protocol built on Cardano
- [Indigo Protocol v2](./Indigo%20v2/) - A synthetic asset protocol build for Cardano
- [Minswap v1](./Minswap%20v2/) - A Decentralized Exchange in Cardano

These projects were chosen, because at the time of submitting the F11 proposal they were the largest protocols by TVL in the Cardano ecosystem.

# Future Steps:
As the project matures, we invite projects to reach out to with any specific needs that we can help research and collaborate on to build a stronger token design pattern for the eUTXO model.  Although there can be almost identical similarities in execution of token designs and mechanisms, to fully innovate and build on the eUTXO model, there will be certain things that can and cannot be done compared to an account-based model, which we'll be striving to identify and build awareness and knowledge on.
